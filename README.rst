==============
Quasi-Mode Key
==============

This is a GUI-fied Pythonic command line.  Inspired by Humanized's Enso, it
repurposes the Caps Lock key so that it controls a prompt that can be used
to run commands written in Python.  For example, one can google something
without switching to a browser first or track a UPS package.  Basically,
anything that can be done with Python!
